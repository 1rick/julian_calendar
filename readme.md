#Convert date to Julian Calendar

Just learning python, so hoping to turn this into a web tool for taking two gregorian calendar inputs and outputting the converted julian calendar dates into a Google date range search string, of the following format:

`barack obama daterange:2454102-2454133`

To my knowledge, there's no range search tool out there, and I'm getting tired of converting to Julian and then bringing that to Google.
